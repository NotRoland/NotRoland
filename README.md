# Hello!
My name is Roland. I'm a Linux enthusiast, python programmer and novice gopher. Currently I'm working on [goosecord](https://github.com/NotRoland/goosecord), a Go wrapper for the Discord API. It aims to be very simple to set up, but with low-level control if required. It's all commented and there's no automatically generated code, every struct is handwritten.

I've also made a couple other things you can find on my Featured Repos list.
