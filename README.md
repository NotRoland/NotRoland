# Hello!
My name is Roland. I'm a Romanian Linux enthusiast, python programmer and novice gopher. I'm currently working on multiple projects which you can find on my pins. Right now my obsessions is networking, which is why I've _attempted_ to make a Discord API Wrapper and why I'm making my own, simple chat app called [rolert](https://github.com/NotRoland/rolert-server).

I also like making UIs / GUI clients with [fyne](https://fyne.io), and will continue using that until I get better at Java to make more advanced interfaces.

[Dogehouse](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse) to the moon!
