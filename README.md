# Hello!
My name is Roland. I'm a Romanian Linux enthusiast, python programmer and novice gopher. I'm currently working on multiple projects which you can find on my pins. Right now my obsessions is networking & working with APIs. I'm currently working on a Discord bot.

I also like making UIs / GUI clients with [fyne](https://fyne.io), and will continue using that until I get better at Java to make more advanced interfaces.
